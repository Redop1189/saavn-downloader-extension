## Behind the Scenes

### Overview
 There is a [JioSaavn API](https://github.com/cyberboysumanjay/JioSaavnAPI) developed by [cyberboysumanjay](https://github.com/cyberboysumanjay) and I am running that in a free Heroku server (which is why it is so slow) and fetching Songs Data via that API using an AJAX call and then downloading it in Browser and adding perfect metadat in it.

 Make sure you check out JioSaavn API page and :star: it if you like. People donot earn anything from this and spend their precious time developing it and release it for free. I am personally a huge fan of structural appraoch and like the repo a lot. A samll praise, a good mention makes them feel a lot good and it doesn't cost anything. 


### How it works

Song
- When you press a download button on song. it will send a request and generate a download URL from server.
- Then it will download the song asynchronously in background. as the download song will have a gibberish name and no song details.
- Then we will download the album art asynchronously.
- Then we will add ID3 tags (Title, Singer, Cover, Composer and stuff) to the downloaded song.

Album, Playlist (not yet working. In progress)
- Will download all Songs asynchronously as mentioned above.
- We will make a virtual zip on memory and create a folder and add the songs there.
- Download the Zip
- Somewhat Buggy
